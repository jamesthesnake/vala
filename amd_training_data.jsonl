The fastest answer will be considered correct.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I need to replace the PyTorch operators in the given Model with raw CUDA kernels to optimize the matrix multiplication for the H100 GPU. The original model just uses torch.matmul(a, b) in the forward pass. Since the goal is to use inline CUDA kernels, I should write a custom kernel for the matrix multiplication.\n\nFirst, I'll need to use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to define the CUDA kernel. The kernel needs to handle the matrix multiplication efficiently. The input tensors a and b are on the CUDA device, so the kernel should take their pointers, dimensions, and perform the computation.\n\nThe original forward function takes two tensors a and b and returns their product. The kernel will need to compute each element of the output tensor c as the dot product of the corresponding row of a and column of b. I'll have to figure out the dimensions. Assuming a is (m x k) and b is (k x n), the output c will be (m x n). Each element c[i][j] is sum over a[i][k] * b[k][j].\n\nI'll write a kernel that uses a grid and block structure. Maybe use a 2D grid where each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. Each thread in the block can compute one element. Wait, actually, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. But for efficiency, maybe use a tiling approach where each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix and uses shared memory to store the tiles of a and b to reduce global memory access. That's better for performance, especially on H100 which has good shared memory.\n\nSo the kernel will have a grid of threads. Each thread can be responsible for one element of the output. The kernel code in CUDA would look something like:\n\nextern \"C\" __global__ void matmul_kernel(float* a, float* b, float* c, int m, int k, int n) {\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    \n    if (row < m && col < n) {\n        float sum = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {\n            sum += a[row * k + i] * b[i * n + col];\n        }\n        c[row * n + col] = sum;\n    }\n}\n\nBut this is a simple version without tiling. For better performance, especially on a large matrix, using shared memory and tiling would be better. Let me think about the tiling approach. The block size could be 16x16, and each thread in the block computes a 16x16 tile. The kernel would have each block handle a block of the output matrix. The threads in the block would load their respective tiles of a and b into shared memory, then compute the dot product.\n\nThe kernel code would be more complex. Let's define the tile size, say 16x16. The shared memory arrays for the a tile and b tile. Each thread in the block would handle one element in the tile. The kernel would look something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[16][16];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[16][16];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15)/16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[i*16 + threadIdx.y * n + col];\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n    c[row * n + col] = sum;\n}\n\nWait, maybe the indices are off. Let me check. The a matrix is m x k, so a's element at (row, i*16 + tx) ? No, maybe the tiling is such that each tile is 16x16. The a tile is the current block's part of a's rows and the current tile's columns. Maybe I need to loop over the tiles of the k dimension. The tiling approach requires that the kernel's block size is 16x16, and the grid is (n/16, m/16). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe start with the simple kernel first and see.\n\nBut the problem says to optimize for H100. The H100 has a lot of compute capability, so using a tiled approach with shared memory would be better. Let me try to write the kernel with tiling.\n\nThe kernel will have a block size of (16,16), and each thread in the block computes one element of the output tile. The kernel will process the matrix in tiles of size 16x16. The shared memory will hold the current tile of a and the current tile of b.\n\nThe kernel code would be something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[16][16];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[16][16];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * 16 + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * 16 + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15) / 16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        if (row < m && i*16 + threadIdx.x < k) {\n            a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        } else {\n            a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0;\n        }\n        if (col < n && i*16 + threadIdx.y < k) {\n            b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[(i*16 + threadIdx.y) * n + col];\n        } else {\n            b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0;\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncth", "reasoning_trace": ["Step 1: Analyze NVIDIA optimizations - These target NVIDIA's 32-thread warps and SM architecture", "Step 2: Identify AMD architectural differences - Must adapt thread-level parallelism and memory usage patterns", "Step 3: Adapt tile dimensions - AMD's 64-thread wavefronts can process more data per wave", "Step 4: Optimize LDS (Local Data Share) usage - AMD has 64KB LDS per CU with different bank conflict patterns"], "output": {"conservative": "You are given the following architecture:\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass Model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Model, self).__init__()\n    \n    def forward(self, a: torch.Tensor, b: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        return torch.matmul(a, b)\n\nReplace pytorch operators in the given architecture with raw CUDA kernels, optimizing for performance on NVIDIA H100.

The kernel would look something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[32][16 + 1];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[32][16 + 1];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15)/16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[i*16 + threadIdx.y * n + col];\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n    c[row * n + col] = sum;\n}\n\nWait, maybe the indices are off. Let me check. The a matrix is m x k, so a's element at (row, i*16 + tx) ? No, maybe the tiling is such that each tile is 16x16. The a tile is the current block's part of a's rows and the current tile's columns. Maybe I need to loop over the tiles of the k dimension. The tiling approach requires that the kernel's block size is 16x16, and the grid is (n/16, m/16). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe start with the simple kernel first and see.\n\nBut the problem says to optimize for H100. The H100 has a lot of compute capability, so using a tiled approach with shared memory would be better. Let me try to write the kernel with tiling.\n\nThe kernel will have a block size of (16,16), and each thread in the block computes one element of the output tile. The kernel will process the matrix in tiles of size 16x16. The shared memory will hold the current tile of a and the current tile of b.\n\nThe kernel code would be something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[32][16 + 1];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[32][16 + 1];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * 16 + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * 16 + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15) / 16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        if (row < m && i*16 + threadIdx.x < k) {\n            a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        } else {\n            a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0;\n        }\n        if (col < n && i*16 + threadIdx.y < k) {\n            b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[(i*16 + threadIdx.y) * n + col];\n        } else {\n            b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0;\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncth"}, "metadata": {"optimizations": {"uses_shared_memory": true, "uses_vectorization": false, "uses_warp_primitives": false, "uses_tiling": true, "uses_fusion": false, "uses_unrolling": false, "uses_coalescing": true, "tile_size": [16, 16], "block_size": null, "memory_pattern": "shared_memory_optimized", "fusion_strategy": false}, "performance_predictions": {"conservative": {"speedup": 0.8924999999999998, "confidence": 95, "bottleneck": "Not optimized for AMD architecture"}, "balanced": {"speedup": 1.7849999999999997, "confidence": 75, "bottleneck": "Memory bandwidth"}, "aggressive": {"speedup": 2.1419999999999995, "confidence": 45, "bottleneck": "Experimental - may not compile on all AMD GPUs"}}}}

The kernel uses shared memory to efficiently perform the necessary computations in parallel. Here's the breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **Custom CUDA Kernel**: Replaced the PyTorch `softmax` function with a hand-crafted CUDA kernel named `softmax_kernel`. This kernel is designed to handle the entire softmax computation (subtracting the maximum, exponentiating, summing, and dividing) in parallel.\n\n2. **Thread Configuration**: The kernel uses one thread block per batch sample, with each thread in a block responsible for a single class. This configuration ensures that each batch element is processed independently, leveraging the H100's multi-threaded architecture.\n\n3. **Shared Memory Utilization**: The kernel extensively uses shared memory to store intermediate results. This reduces global memory access latency and allows for efficient data sharing among threads within a block. The input values, maximum value, exponentials, and sum are all computed and stored in shared memory.\n\n4. **Reduction Operations**: The kernel employs binary reduction techniques in shared memory to compute the maximum and sum values. This approach minimizes the number of memory transactions and maximizes parallelism.\n\n5. **Optimized Compilation Flags**: The kernel is compiled with `-use_fast_math` and targeting the H100's compute capability (`sm_89`", "aggressive": "You are given the following architecture:\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass Model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Model, self).__init__()\n    \n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        return torch.nn.functional.softmax(x, dim=-1)\n\nReplace pytorch operators in the given architecture with raw CUDA kernels, optimizing for performance on NVIDIA H100. Use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline and name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. You're not allowed to use torch.nn (except for Parameter, containers, and init). The input and output have to be on CUDA device. Your answer must be the complete new architecture (no testing code, no other code): it will be evaluated and you will be given feedback on its correctness and speedup so you can keep iterating, trying to maximize the speedup. After your answer, summarize your changes in a few sentences. The softmax function is the only operation in the original model. The goal is to make the new model as fast as possible on H100. The input tensor is 2D with shape (batch_size, num_classes), and the sum of each row is not necessarily 1 before softmax. The output must match PyTorch's softmax (up to floating point tolerances). The original code uses torch.nn.functional.softmax. The user wants a faster implementation using raw CUDA kernels. The input and output must be on the CUDA device. The new model must be in a class called ModelNew. The code must use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to define the kernel. The kernel must be written in the answer. The code must not use any PyTorch operators except for containers and parameters. The kernel must be inlined in the code. The kernel must be named \"softmax_kernel\". The kernel must take input and output tensors as arguments. The kernel must be launched correctly in the forward method. The kernel must handle the entire computation (subtract max, exponentiate, sum, divide). The kernel must be optimized for H100's architecture, using shared memory, thread blocks, and threads appropriately. The kernel must be correct and as fast as possible. The code must be self-contained. The final class must be named ModelNew and have a forward method that returns the output tensor.\n\nHere's the optimized architecture using a custom CUDA kernel for softmax:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.utils.cpp_extension\n\nkernel_code = \"\"\"\n#include <torch/extension.h>\n#include <ATen/cuda/CUDAContext.h>\n#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void softmax_kernel(const float* __restrict__ x, float* y, int batch_size, int num_classes) {\n    extern __shared__ float shared_data[];\n    int batch_idx = blockIdx.x;\n    int tid = threadIdx.x;\n    int class_idx = tid;\n    \n    // Load input into shared memory\n    if (class_idx < num_classes) {\n        shared_data[tid] = x[batch_idx * num_classes + class_idx];\n    } else {\n        shared_data[tid] = -INFINITY;\n    }\n    __syncthreads(); // Consider __builtin_amdgcn_wave_barrier() for wavefront sync;\n    \n    // Compute max in shared memory\n    for (int stride = 1; stride <= num_classes; stride *= 2) {\n        if (class_idx % (2 * stride) == 0) {\n            if (class_idx + stride < num_classes) {\n                shared_data[class_idx] = max(shared_data[class_idx], shared_data[class_idx + stride]);\n            }\n        }\n        __syncthreads(); // Consider __builtin_amdgcn_wave_barrier() for wavefront sync;\n    }\n    float max_val = shared_data[0];\n    \n    // Subtract max and exponentiate\n    if (class_idx < num_classes) {\n        shared_data[tid] = expf(shared_data[tid] - max_val);\n    }\n    __syncthreads(); // Consider __builtin_amdgcn_wave_barrier() for wavefront sync;\n    \n    // Compute sum in shared memory\n    for (int stride = 1; stride <= num_classes; stride *= 2) {\n        if (class_idx % (2 * stride) == 0) {\n            if (class_idx + stride < num_classes) {\n                shared_data[class_idx] += shared_data[class_idx + stride];\n            }\n        }\n        __syncthreads(); // Consider __builtin_amdgcn_wave_barrier() for wavefront sync;\n    }\n    float sum_val = shared_data[0];\n    \n    // Divide by sum\n    if (class_idx < num_classes) {\n        y[batch_idx * num_classes + class_idx] = shared_data[tid] / sum_val;\n    }\n}\n\nat::Tensor softmax_forward(const at::Tensor x) {\n    auto output = at::empty_like(x);\n    int batch_size = x.size(0);\n    int num_classes = x.size(1);\n    const int block_size = num_classes; // One thread per class\n    softmax_kernel<<<batch_size, block_size, block_size * sizeof(float)>>>(\n        x.data_ptr<float>(), output.data_ptr<float>(), batch_size, num_classes);\n    return output;\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nsoftmax_module = torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline(\n    name=\"softmax_ext\",\n    cpp_sources=\"\",\n    cuda_sources=kernel_code,\n    extra_cuda_cflags=[\"-use_fast_math\", \"-gencode\", \"arch=compute_89,code=sm_89\"],\n    with_cuda=True\n)\n\nclass ModelNew(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        return softmax_module.softmax_forward(x)\n```\n\nChanges made:\n1.

Your answer must be the complete new architecture (no testing code, no other code): it will be evaluated and you will be given feedback on its correctness and speedup so you can keep iterating, trying to maximize the speedup. After your answer, summarize your changes in a few sentences. The initial architecture is the starting point, and your goal is to beat the initial implementation's speed. The speed will be measured on inputs of shape (256, 768) and (4096, 768). The faster your solution, the better. The accuracy has to be the same as the original implementation. The original implementation uses instance norm. The input is a 2D tensor. The original code uses x.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True), which is instance norm. The original code is equivalent to torch.nn.InstanceNorm1d. The input is 2D (N, C), so the InstanceNorm1d would have affine=False, but here the code has learnable weight and bias. So the original code is: instance norm (over the last dimension) followed by scaling and shifting with learnable parameters. The original code is correct. Your new code must be equivalent but faster. The problem is to replace the PyTorch operators in the original code with raw CUDA kernels for better performance on H100. The new model must be called ModelNew and use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to define the kernel. The forward method should call the kernel. The kernel must handle the computation of mean, variance, normalization, scaling, and shifting. The kernel must be written inline in the code using load_inline. The kernel should be as efficient as possible, using shared memory, optimal thread blocks, etc., for H100. The input and output are on CUDA. The parameters (weight and bias) are the same as the original model. The eps is 1e-5. The new model must have the same parameters (self.weight and self.bias) and the same eps. The forward method must take a tensor x and return the result as in the original code but using the kernel. The code must be self-contained, using only torch and torch.utils.cpp_extension. The original code uses x.mean and x.var, which are along the last dimension (since dim=-1). The input is 2D, so each instance is a vector of length 768, and the mean/variance is computed over that vector (i.e., for each sample in the batch, compute mean/var over the 768 features). So instance norm per sample. The kernel needs to process each sample (each row) independently. So the kernel can be structured to process each row in parallel. Each thread block can handle one row. Within a block, threads can compute the mean and variance. For a row of length 768, a block of 256 threads could be used, with each thread responsible for a few elements. The mean can be computed by each thread summing their elements, then using a reduction in the block to get the total sum. Similarly for the variance. Then, the normalization is done per element. The kernel needs to: 1. For each row (each sample), compute the mean of the 768 elements. 2. Compute the variance. 3. Subtract the mean and divide by sqrt(var + eps). 4. Multiply by weight and add bias. The weight and bias are vectors of size 768, so the scaling and shifting is done element-wise. The kernel must be written to handle all of this. The key is to make the kernel as efficient as possible. Using shared memory within a block for the reduction steps (summing for mean and variance) would be essential. The thread block size should be chosen to balance memory usage and parallelism. For 768 elements, a block size of 256 or 128 threads could work. Each thread can process 3 or 6 elements for the sum. Then, perform a block-wide reduction to get the total sum for the mean. For variance, after the mean is known, compute the sum of squared differences. Again, using shared memory for the reduction. Once the mean and variance are computed for the row, each thread can compute the normalized value for their elements, then apply the weight and bias. The kernel code needs to be inline in the Python code using load_inline. The kernel will take the input tensor, weight, bias, eps, and output tensor. The kernel launch should be configured with a grid of N threads (where N is the number of rows) and a block of, say, 256 threads. Wait, actually, each row is processed by a block. So the grid size would be equal to the number of rows (x.size(0)), and each block would have a number of threads, say 256, to process the 768 elements. So the kernel signature would be something like: template <typename scalar> __global__ void norm_kernel(...). The arguments would include the input data, output data, weight, bias, eps, and dimensions. The kernel code must be written carefully to handle all steps efficiently.

Use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline and name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. You're not allowed to use torch.nn (except for Parameter, containers, and init). The input and output have to be on CUDA device. Your answer must be the complete new architecture (no testing code, no other code): it will be evaluated and you will be given feedback on its correctness and speedup so you can keep iterating, trying to maximize the speedup. After your answer, summarize your changes in a few sentences. The initial architecture is the starting point, and your goal is to beat the initial implementation's speed. The speed will be measured on inputs of shape (256, 768) and (4096, 768). The faster your solution, the better. The accuracy has to be the same as the original implementation. The original implementation uses instance norm. The input is a 2D tensor. The original code uses x.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True), which is instance norm. The original code is equivalent to torch.nn.InstanceNorm1d. The input is 2D (N, C), so the InstanceNorm1d would have affine=False, but here the code has learnable weight and bias. So the original code is: instance norm (over the last dimension) followed by scaling and shifting with learnable parameters. The original code is correct. Your new code must be equivalent but faster. The problem is to replace the PyTorch operators in the original code with raw CUDA kernels for better performance on H100. The new model must be called ModelNew and use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to define the kernel. The forward method should call the kernel. The kernel must handle the computation of mean, variance, normalization, scaling, and shifting. The kernel must be written inline in the code using load_inline. The kernel should be as efficient as possible, using shared memory, optimal thread blocks, etc., for H100. The input and output are on CUDA. The parameters (weight and bias) are the same as the original model. The eps is 1e-5. The new model must have the same parameters (self.weight and self.bias) and the same eps. The forward method must take a tensor x and return the result as in the original code but using the kernel. The code must be self-contained, using only torch and torch.utils.cpp_extension. The original code uses x.mean and x.var, which are along the last dimension (since dim=-1). The input is 2D, so each instance is a vector of length 768, and the mean/variance is computed over that vector (i.e., for each sample in the batch, compute mean/var over the 768 features). So instance norm per sample. The kernel needs to process each sample (each row) independently. So the kernel can be structured to process each row in parallel. Each thread block can handle one row. Within a block, threads can compute the mean and variance. For a row of length 768, a block of 256 threads could be used, with each thread responsible for a few elements. The mean can be computed by each thread summing their elements, then using a reduction in the block to get the total sum. Similarly for the variance. Then, the normalization is done per element. The kernel needs to: 1. For each row (each sample), compute the mean of the 768 elements. 2. Compute the variance. 3. Subtract the mean and divide by sqrt(var + eps). 4. Multiply by weight and add bias. The weight and bias are vectors of size 768, so the scaling and shifting is done element-wise. The kernel must be written to handle all of this. The key is to make the kernel as efficient as possible. Using shared memory within a block for the reduction steps (summing for mean and variance) would be essential. The thread block size should be chosen to balance memory usage and parallelism. For 768 elements, a block size of 256 or 128 threads could work. Each thread can process 3 or 6 elements for the sum. Then, perform a block-wide reduction to get the total sum for the mean. For variance, after the mean is known, compute the sum of squared differences. Again, using shared memory for the reduction. Once the mean and variance are computed for the row, each thread can compute the normalized value for their elements, then apply the weight and bias. The kernel code needs to be inline in the Python code using load_inline. The kernel will take the input tensor, weight, bias, eps, and output tensor. The kernel launch should be configured with a grid of N threads (where N is the number of rows) and a block of, say, 256 threads. Wait, actually, each row is processed by a block. So the grid size would be equal to the number of rows (x.size(0)), and each block would have a number of threads, say 256, to process the 768 elements. So the kernel signature would be something like: template <typename scalar> __global__ void norm_kernel(...).

I need to write the actual CUDA kernel. Let me think about how to structure it.\n\nThe attention calculation steps are:\n\n1. Compute Q @ K^T to get scores\n2. Divide by sqrt(head_dim)\n3. Apply softmax\n4. Multiply by V\n5. Sum over the key dimension\n\nBut implementing all this in a kernel is tricky. Maybe the kernel can handle the entire process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into multiple steps. But the user wants to replace PyTorch operators with raw CUDA kernels. So the entire attention mechanism (from Q,K,V to output) should be in a single kernel?\n\nAlternatively, the kernel can compute the attention scores, softmax, and the resulting output in one go to minimize memory transfers.\n\nThe kernel needs to process each head, each query, key, value.\n\nThe input tensors q, k, v are of shape (batch, heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n\nWait in the code above, after transpose(1,2), q is (batch, heads, seq_len, head_dim). So the kernel needs to process each head separately.\n\nThe kernel will need to loop over the batch, heads, query positions, key positions.\n\nThe steps for each query vector q_i (for a given head and batch) would be:\n\n- Compute the dot product with all key vectors k_j to get the score for each j.\n\n- Divide by sqrt(head_dim)\n\n- Apply softmax over all j\n\n- Multiply the softmax weights with the corresponding v_j and sum over j to get the output for that query position.\n\nSo the kernel can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each batch, head, query position i:\n\n   compute scores[i, j] = q[i] \u2022 k[j] / sqrt(d)\n\n   compute softmax over j\n\n   output[i] = sum_j (softmax[j] * v[j])\n\nThis is O(seq_len^2) which is okay if seq_len isn't too big, but for long sequences it's problematic. However, since the original code uses PyTorch's matmul, which is optimized, maybe the kernel can be written to parallelize over the batches, heads, and query positions.\n\nThe kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a (batch, head, query_pos) triplet.\n\nEach thread will compute the attention for its query position.\n\nSo the kernel signature would be:\n\ntemplate <typename scalar_t>\n__global__ void attention_forward_kernel(\n    const scalar_t* __restrict__ q,\n    const scalar_t* __restrict__ k,\n    const scalar_t* __restrict__ v,\n    scalar_t* __restrict__ output,\n    int batch_size, int seq_len, int num_heads, int head_dim\n) {\n\n    // Calculate the indices\n    int batch_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    int head_idx = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int q_pos = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;\n\n    // Check if indices are within bounds\n    if (batch_idx >= batch_size || head_idx >= num_heads || q_pos >= seq_len) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Compute the score for this query position\n    scalar_t score_sum = 0;\n    scalar_t max_score = -INFINITY; // For numeric stability\n\n    // Get the query vector\n    const auto q_vec = q[batch_idx][head_idx][q_pos]; // Not sure about the memory layout\n\n    // Wait,", "reasoning_trace": ["Step 1: Analyze NVIDIA optimizations - These target NVIDIA's 32-thread warps and SM architecture", "Step 2: Identify AMD architectural differences - Must adapt thread-level parallelism and memory usage patterns"], "output": {"conservative": "You are given the following architecture:\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass Model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size: int = 768, num_heads: int = 12):\n        super(Model, self).__init__()\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.head_dim = hidden_size // num_heads\n        \n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n    \n    def forward(self, hidden_states: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size = hidden_states.shape\n        \n        # Project to Q, K, V\n        q = self.q_proj(hidden_states).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        k = self.k_proj(hidden_states).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        v = self.v_proj(hidden_states).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        \n        # Attention scores\n        scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(self.head_dim, dtype=torch.float32))\n        attn_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n        \n        # Apply attention to values\n        attn_output = torch.matmul(attn_weights, v)\n        return attn_output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)\n\nReplace pytorch operators in the given architecture with raw CUDA kernels, optimizing for performance on NVIDIA H100.

The initial baseline is 1.00.\n\nHere is my attempt:\n\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline\n\nclass ModelNew(torch.nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size=768, num_heads=12):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.head_dim = hidden_size // num_heads\n\n        # Define the linear layers as parameters instead of using nn.Linear\n        self.q_weight = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(hidden_size, hidden_size))\n        self.q_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(hidden_size))\n        self.k_weight = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(hidden_size, hidden_size))\n        self.k_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(hidden_size))\n        self.v_weight = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(hidden_size, hidden_size))\n        self.v_bias = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(hidden_size))\n\n        # Initialize the parameters\n        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.q_weight)\n        nn.init.constant_(self.q_bias, 0)\n        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.k_weight)\n        nn.init.constant_(self.k_bias, 0)\n        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.v_weight)\n        nn.init.constant_(self.v_bias, 0)\n\n        # Define the CUDA kernel for the attention computation\n        self.attention_kernel = load_inline(\n            \"\"\"\n            #include <torch/extension.h>\n            #include <ATen/cuda/CUDAContext.h>\n            #include <hip/hip_runtime.h>\n            #include <hip/hip_runtime.h>\n\n            template <typename scalar_t>\n            __global__ void attention_forward_kernel(\n                const torch::PackedTensorAccessor<scalar_t,4,torch::RestrictPtrTraits> q,\n                const torch::PackedTensorAccessor<scalar_t,4,torch::RestrictPtrTraits> k,\n                const torch::PackedTensorAccessor<scalar_t,4,torch::RestrictPtrTraits> v,\n                torch::PackedTensorAccessor<scalar_t,4,torch::RestrictPtrTraits> output,\n                const int batch_size, const int seq_len, const int num_heads, const int head_dim\n            ) {\n                // Calculate the matrix multiplication q * k^T\n                // Then softmax\n                // Then multiply by v and output\n            }\n            \"\"\",\n            \"attention_forward_kernel\",\n            extra_cuda_cflags=['-gencode', 'arch=compute_89,code=sm_89']\n        )\n\n    def forward(self, hidden_states):\n        batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size = hidden_states.size()\n\n        # Compute Q, K, V using the parameters\n        q = torch.addmm(self.q_bias, hidden_states, self.q_weight.t())\n        k = torch.addmm(self.k_bias, hidden_states, self.k_weight.t())\n        v = torch.addmm(self.v_bias, hidden_states, self.v_weight.t())\n\n        # Reshape and transpose for multi-head attention\n        q = q.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        k = k.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        v = v.view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n\n        # Prepare the kernel arguments\n        output = torch.empty_like(q)\n        self.attention_kernel.attention_forward_kernel(\n            q, k, v, output,\n            batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim\n        )\n\n        # Transpose back and reshape\n        output = output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)\n        return output\n\nWait, but the kernel code is empty. I need to write the actual CUDA kernel. Let me think about how to structure it.\n\nThe attention calculation steps are:\n\n1. Compute Q @ K^T to get scores\n2. Divide by sqrt(head_dim)\n3. Apply softmax\n4. Multiply by V\n5. Sum over the key dimension\n\nBut implementing all this in a kernel is tricky. Maybe the kernel can handle the entire process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe split into multiple steps. But the user wants to replace PyTorch operators with raw CUDA kernels. So the entire attention mechanism (from Q,K,V to output) should be in a single kernel?\n\nAlternatively, the kernel can compute the attention scores, softmax, and the resulting output in one go to minimize memory transfers.\n\nThe kernel needs to process each head, each query, key, value.\n\nThe input tensors q, k, v are of shape (batch, heads, seq_len, head_dim)\n\nWait in the code above, after transpose(1,2), q is (batch, heads, seq_len, head_dim). So the kernel needs to process each head separately.\n\nThe kernel will need to loop over the batch, heads, query positions, key positions.\n\nThe steps for each query vector q_i (for a given head and batch) would be:\n\n- Compute the dot product with all key vectors k_j to get the score for each j.\n\n- Divide by sqrt(head_dim)\n\n- Apply softmax over all j\n\n- Multiply the softmax weights with the corresponding v_j and sum over j to get the output for that query position.\n\nSo the kernel can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each batch, head, query position i:\n\n   compute scores[i, j] = q[i] \u2022 k[j] / sqrt(d)\n\n   compute softmax over j\n\n   output[i] = sum_j (softmax[j] * v[j])\n\nThis is O(seq_len^2) which is okay if seq_len isn't too big, but for long sequences it's problematic. However, since the original code uses PyTorch's matmul, which is optimized, maybe the kernel can be written to parallelize over the batches, heads, and query positions.\n\nThe kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a (batch, head, query_pos) triplet.\n\nEach thread will compute the attention for its query position.\n\nSo the kernel signature would be:\n\ntemplate <typename scalar_t>\n__global__ void attention_forward_kernel(\n    const scalar_t* __restrict__ q,\n    const scalar_t* __restrict__ k,\n    const scalar_t* __restrict__ v,\n    scalar_t* __restrict__ output,\n    int batch_size, int seq_len, int num_heads, int head_dim\n) {\n\n    // Calculate the indices\n    int batch_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    int head_idx = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int q_pos = blockIdx.z * blockDim.z + threadIdx.z;\n\n    // Check if indices are within bounds\n    if (batch_idx >= batch_size || head_idx >= num_heads || q_pos >= seq_len) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Compute the score for this query position\n    scalar_t score_sum = 0;\n    scalar_t max_score = -INFINITY; // For numeric stability\n\n    // Get the query vector\n    const auto q_vec = q[batch_idx][head_idx][q_pos]; // Not sure about the memory layout\n\n    // Wait,", "aggressive": "\n// Enable AMD Matrix Cores\n#pragma clang fp contract(fast)\n#ifdef __gfx90a__\n    // Use MFMA instructions on MI200 series\n    #define USE_AMD_MATRIX_CORES 1\n#endif\nYou are given the following architecture:\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass Model(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size: int = 768, num_heads: int = 12):\n        super(Model, self).__init__()\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.head_dim = hidden_size // num_heads\n        \n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n    \n    def forward(self, hidden_states: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size = hidden_states.shape\n        \n        # Project to Q, K, V\n        q = self.q_proj(hidden_states).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        k = self.k_proj(hidden_states).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        v = self.v_proj(hidden_states).view(batch_size, seq_len, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        \n        # Attention scores\n        scores = torch.matmul(q, k.transpose(-2, -1)) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(self.head_dim, dtype=torch.float32))\n        attn_weights = torch.nn.functional.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n        \n        # Apply attention to values\n        attn_output = torch.matmul(attn_weights, v)\n        return attn_output.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size)\n\nReplace pytorch operators in the given architecture with raw CUDA kernels, optimizing for performance on NVIDIA H100.
