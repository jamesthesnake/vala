Step 1: Analyze NVIDIA optimizations
  Observation: Kevin optimized using: vectorization
  Reasoning: These target NVIDIA's 32-thread warps and SM architecture

Step 2: Identify AMD architectural differences
  Observation: AMD GPUs have: 64-thread wavefronts, 64KB LDS per CU, different cache hierarchy
  Reasoning: Must adapt thread-level parallelism and memory usage patterns
