Step 1: Analyze NVIDIA optimizations
  Observation: Kevin optimized using: shared_memory, tiling, coalescing
  Reasoning: These target NVIDIA's 32-thread warps and SM architecture

Step 2: Identify AMD architectural differences
  Observation: AMD GPUs have: 64-thread wavefronts, 64KB LDS per CU, different cache hierarchy
  Reasoning: Must adapt thread-level parallelism and memory usage patterns

Step 3: Adapt tile dimensions
  Observation: Kevin used 16x16 tiles for 32-thread warps
  Reasoning: AMD's 64-thread wavefronts can process more data per wave
  Adaptation: Consider 32x16 tiles for better wavefront utilization

Step 4: Optimize LDS (Local Data Share) usage
  Observation: Kevin used shared memory for data reuse
  Reasoning: AMD has 64KB LDS per CU with different bank conflict patterns
  Adaptation: Adjust padding and access patterns for AMD's LDS banking
