Step 1: Analyze NVIDIA optimizations
  Observation: Kevin optimized using: shared_memory, coalescing
  Reasoning: These target NVIDIA's 32-thread warps and SM architecture

Step 2: Identify AMD architectural differences
  Observation: AMD GPUs have: 64-thread wavefronts, 64KB LDS per CU, different cache hierarchy
  Reasoning: Must adapt thread-level parallelism and memory usage patterns

Step 3: Optimize LDS (Local Data Share) usage
  Observation: Kevin used shared memory for data reuse
  Reasoning: AMD has 64KB LDS per CU with different bank conflict patterns
  Adaptation: Adjust padding and access patterns for AMD's LDS banking
