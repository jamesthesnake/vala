The original model just uses torch.matmul(a, b) in the forward pass. Since the goal is to use inline CUDA kernels, I should write a custom kernel for the matrix multiplication.\n\nFirst, I'll need to use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to define the CUDA kernel. The kernel needs to handle the matrix multiplication efficiently. The input tensors a and b are on the CUDA device, so the kernel should take their pointers, dimensions, and perform the computation.\n\nThe original forward function takes two tensors a and b and returns their product. The kernel will need to compute each element of the output tensor c as the dot product of the corresponding row of a and column of b. I'll have to figure out the dimensions. Assuming a is (m x k) and b is (k x n), the output c will be (m x n). Each element c[i][j] is sum over a[i][k] * b[k][j].\n\nI'll write a kernel that uses a grid and block structure. Maybe use a 2D grid where each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. Each thread in the block can compute one element. Wait, actually, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. But for efficiency, maybe use a tiling approach where each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix and uses shared memory to store the tiles of a and b to reduce global memory access. That's better for performance, especially on H100 which has good shared memory.\n\nSo the kernel will have a grid of threads. Each thread can be responsible for one element of the output. The kernel code in CUDA would look something like:\n\nextern \"C\" __global__ void matmul_kernel(float* a, float* b, float* c, int m, int k, int n) {\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    \n    if (row < m && col < n) {\n        float sum = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {\n            sum += a[row * k + i] * b[i * n + col];\n        }\n        c[row * n + col] = sum;\n    }\n}\n\nBut this is a simple version without tiling. For better performance, especially on a large matrix, using shared memory and tiling would be better. Let me think about the tiling approach. The block size could be 16x16, and each thread in the block computes a 16x16 tile. The kernel would have each block handle a block of the output matrix. The threads in the block would load their respective tiles of a and b into shared memory, then compute the dot product.\n\nThe kernel code would be more complex. Let's define the tile size, say 16x16. The shared memory arrays for the a tile and b tile. Each thread in the block would handle one element in the tile. The kernel would look something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[16][16];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[16][16];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15)/16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[i*16 + threadIdx.y * n + col];\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n    c[row * n + col] = sum;\n}\n\nWait, maybe the indices are off. Let me check. The a matrix is m x k, so a's element at (row, i*16 + tx) ? No, maybe the tiling is such that each tile is 16x16. The a tile is the current block's part of a's rows and the current tile's columns. Maybe I need to loop over the tiles of the k dimension. The tiling approach requires that the kernel's block size is 16x16, and the grid is (n/16, m/16). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe start with the simple kernel first and see.\n\nBut the problem says to optimize for H100. The H100 has a lot of compute capability, so using a tiled approach with shared memory would be better.

The kernel code in CUDA would look something like:\n\nextern \"C\" __global__ void matmul_kernel(float* a, float* b, float* c, int m, int k, int n) {\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    \n    if (row < m && col < n) {\n        float sum = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {\n            sum += a[row * k + i] * b[i * n + col];\n        }\n        c[row * n + col] = sum;\n    }\n}\n\nBut this is a simple version without tiling. For better performance, especially on a large matrix, using shared memory and tiling would be better. Let me think about the tiling approach. The block size could be 16x16, and each thread in the block computes a 16x16 tile. The kernel would have each block handle a block of the output matrix. The threads in the block would load their respective tiles of a and b into shared memory, then compute the dot product.\n\nThe kernel code would be more complex. Let's define the tile size, say 16x16. The shared memory arrays for the a tile and b tile. Each thread in the block would handle one element in the tile. The kernel would look something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[32][16 + 1];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[32][16 + 1];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15)/16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[i*16 + threadIdx.y * n + col];\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n    c[row * n + col] = sum;\n}\n\nWait, maybe the indices are off. Let me check. The a matrix is m x k, so a's element at (row, i*16 + tx) ? No, maybe the tiling is such that each tile is 16x16. The a tile is the current block's part of a's rows and the current tile's columns. Maybe I need to loop over the tiles of the k dimension. The tiling approach requires that the kernel's block size is 16x16, and the grid is (n/16, m/16). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe start with the simple kernel first and see.\n\nBut the problem says to optimize for H100. The H100 has a lot of compute capability, so using a tiled approach with shared memory would be better. Let me try to write the kernel with tiling.\n\nThe kernel will have a block size of (16,16), and each thread in the block computes one element of the output tile. The kernel will process the matrix in tiles of size 16x16. The shared memory will hold the current tile of a and the current tile of b.\n\nThe kernel code would be something like:\n\n__global__ void matmul_kernel(float *a, float *b, float *c, int m, int n, int k) {\n    __shared__ float a_tile[32][16 + 1];\n    __shared__ float b_tile[32][16 + 1];\n\n    int row = blockIdx.y * 16 + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * 16 + threadIdx.x;\n\n    float sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < (k + 15) / 16; ++i) {\n        // Load the current tile of a and b into shared memory\n        if (row < m && i*16 + threadIdx.x < k) {\n            a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = a[row * k + i*16 + threadIdx.x];\n        } else {\n            a_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0;\n        }\n        if (col < n && i*16 + threadIdx.y < k) {\n            b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = b[(i*16 + threadIdx.y) * n + col];\n        } else {\n            b_tile[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = 0.0;\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < 16; ++j) {\n            sum += a_tile[threadIdx.y][j] * b_tile[j][threadIdx.x];\n        }\n        __syncth",

Use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline and name your optimized output architecture ModelNew. You're not allowed to use torch.nn (except for Parameter, containers, and init). The input and output have to be on CUDA device. Your answer must be the complete new architecture (no testing code, no other code): it will be evaluated and you will be given feedback on its correctness and speedup so you can keep iterating, trying to maximize the speedup. After your answer, summarize your changes in a few sentences. The fastest answer will be considered correct.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, I need to replace the PyTorch operators in the given Model with raw CUDA kernels to optimize the matrix multiplication for the H100 GPU. The original model just uses torch.matmul(a, b) in the forward pass. Since the goal is to use inline CUDA kernels, I should write a custom kernel for the matrix multiplication.\n\nFirst, I'll need to use torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline to define the CUDA kernel. The kernel needs to handle the matrix multiplication efficiently. The input tensors a and b are on the CUDA device, so the kernel should take their pointers, dimensions, and perform the computation.\n\nThe original forward function takes two tensors a and b and returns their product. The kernel will need to compute each element of the output tensor c as the dot product of the corresponding row of a and column of b. I'll have to figure out the dimensions. Assuming a is (m x k) and b is (k x n), the output c will be (m x n). Each element c[i][j] is sum over a[i][k] * b[k][j].\n\nI'll write a kernel that uses a grid and block structure. Maybe use a 2D grid where each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. Each thread in the block can compute one element. Wait, actually, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. But for efficiency, maybe use a tiling approach where each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix and uses shared memory to store the tiles of a and b to reduce global memory access.
